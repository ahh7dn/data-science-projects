    "From an initial interpretation of the new plots with agricultural land included, there is no striking relationship to be found between agricultural land and the other two variables. Calculating the correlations between all of the variables supported this interpretation of the plots. While there may be some minor correlation between agriculture and the other variables, this relationship is much weaker than the second hypothesis would have expected. Because of the weakness of these correlations, the analysis does not support the second hypothesis and the hypothesis is rejected. "
